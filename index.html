        <h2>Giphy Guess game</h2>
        <p>Giphy Guess Game is a game where the user is presented with four images which have been derived from a single word. The user tries to guess each word for all the rounds as quickly as they can. The quicker the user gets all the questions correct the better their score.
        </br>Giphy Guess Game started as a group assignment in my coding bootcamp. I collaborated with three others to build this application. The application relies on two server side API calls; WordsAPI and GiphyAPI. This application continues to be subject to changes and updates.

        <h2>Weather Dashboard</h2>
        <p>The classic weather application- cousin of the ‘To Do list' for new javascript hopefuls. This was another coding bootcamp assignment and the first time I used server side API calls in my work. This application relies on 2 API calls. The first, to get the latitude and longitude of the user’s chosen location, and second to retrieve the current weather, and the forecast for the next five days.

        <h2>Day planner</h2>
        <p>The Day Planner application keeps track of tasks allocated to every hour of a 9am-5pm work day. The current date and time are displayed at the top of the page. The content for each hour block can be updated and saved between reloads. The application will dynamically colour each hour block depending if that hour is in the past (grey), present (green) or future (yellow).

            <h2>Zen Blocks</h2>
            <p>This web application is not fully developed yet but it is one favourites. It does not really <i>do</i> anything. You simply move your cursor around the screen and enjoy the colours. The text input allows you to choose which colour you want generate on the screen (though this is a bit buggy and sometimes requires you to reload the page a few times before it works) or you can generate random colours, you toggle between the two options using the button labelled "random or your colours". I built this project while I was learning to use event listeners in Javascript! **This project was developed for browser use only
