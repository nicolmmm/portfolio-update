            <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hi! I am a 28 year old software developer hopeful from Sydney, Australia. I have been learning how to code for the past year. Previously I worked as a diversional therapist and I still work as a photographer on the side. I hold a Bachelor of Visual Arts and Design from ACU. </br></br>
                I know HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>

            <h2>Zen Blocks</h2>
            <p>This web application is not fully developed yet but it is one favourites. It does not really <i>do</i> anything. You simply move your cursor around the screen and enjoy the colours. The text input allows you to choose which colour you want generate on the screen (though this is a bit buggy and sometimes requires you to reload the page a few times before it works) or you can generate random colours, you toggle between the two options using the button labelled "random or your colours". I built this project while I was learning to use event listeners in Javascript! **This project was developed for browser use only</i></p>

                <h2>Facebook</h2>
                <p>My other web application is called Facebook. Facebook is a social media platform which you can use to stay in touch with your friends and take quizes! You can also play a neat game called farmville. This application still has some kinks and may cause a civil war. </p>
